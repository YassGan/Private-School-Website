## Introduction

The Private School Website is a comprehensive web application designed to provide both the school administration and its clients with easy access to relevant information. The website is composed of two main sections: the first one, built using WordPress, showcases general information about the school and its programs through four main pages: Home, About Us, Contact Us, and School Life.

The second section, built using PHP, is dedicated to information management. There are two distinct user sessions: the admin session, intended for the school director, which enables them to manage information about pupils, teachers, classes, grades, payments, absences, and more. The other session is intended for the school's clients, who can access a personalized space where they can view their grades, absence history, and payment status.

The goal of this project is to simplify school management for the director and allow parents to easily follow-up on their children's progress.

In this README file, you will find information about the website's main features, a demo of the website in action, and instructions on how to install the project on your own machine.
